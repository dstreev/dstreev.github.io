We've added a Web interface to <code class="code" id="qhepgb_28">hms-mirror</code> that makes it easier to configure and run varies scenarios.</p><p id="qhepgb_17">Along with the Web interface, we've made some significant adjustments to the <code class="code" id="qhepgb_29">hms-mirror</code> engine which is much more complete than the previous release.

These changes will be recorded in the 'run status config messages' section and can be seen on reports or the web interface.</p><p id="qhepgb_31">Changes are mostly related to the acceptable strategy configurations.

These could be supplied through the cli option <code class="code" id="qhepgb_59">-glm</code>, which is still supported, but limited in functionality. The improved implementation work from the concept of building 'Warehouse Plans' which are then used to build the 'Global Location Maps'.</p><p id="qhepgb_50">See <span id="qhepgb_60">Warehouse Plans</span> for more details.</p><p id="qhepgb_51">The <code class="code" id="qhepgb_61">-glm</code> option can take an addition element to identify the mapping for a particular table type. As a result, any configuration files save with this setting will not be loaded and will need to be updated.</p><p id="qhepgb_52">While the <code class="code" id="qhepgb_62">-glm</code> option will still honor the old format of <code class="code" id="qhepgb_63">source_dir=target_dir</code>, the new format is <code class="code" id="qhepgb_64">source_dir:&lt;table_type&gt;:target_dir</code>. The <code class="code" id="qhepgb_65">table_type</code> is a new addition to the configuration and is required for the new implementation. When omitted, the mapping will be created for both EXTERNAL and MANAGED tables.</p><p id="qhepgb_53"><code class="code" id="qhepgb_66">&lt;table_type&gt;</code> can be one of: <code class="code" id="qhepgb_67">EXTERNAL_TABLE</code> or <code class="code" id="qhepgb_68">MANAGED_TABLE</code>.</p><p id="qhepgb_54"><code class="code" id="qhepgb_69">-glm /tpsds_base_dir=EXTERNAL_TABLE:/alt/ext/location</code></p><p id="qhepgb_55"><span class="control" id="qhepgb_70">Old Format</span></p><div class="code-block" data-lang="yaml">

Currently, <code class="code" id="qhepgb_76">hms-mirror</code> can only support a single Kerberos connection. This is the same as it was previously. <code class="code" id="qhepgb_77">hms-mirror</code> packaging includes the core Hadoop classes required for Kerberos connections pulled from the latest CDP release.</p><p id="qhepgb_74">In the past, we 'could' support kerberos connections to lower versions of Hadoop clusters (HDP and CDH) by running <code class="code" id="qhepgb_78">hms-mirror</code> on a cluster with those hadoop libraries installed and specifying <code class="code" id="qhepgb_79">--hadoop-classpath</code> on the commandline. This is no longer supported, as the packaging required to support the Web and REST interfaces is now different.</p><p id="qhepgb_75">We are investigating the possibility of supporting kerberos connections to lower clusters in the future.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="metastore-direct-access" data-toc="metastore-direct-access">Metastore Direct Access</h3><p id="qhepgb_80">In later 1.6 releases we introduced a 'Metastore Direct' connection type when defining a LEFT(source) cluster. To help build a more complete picture of locations in the metadata, we found it necessary to gather detailed location information for each partition of the datasets being inspected. Because Hive was so configurable regarding location preferences and the ability to set locations at the partition level, we needed to ensure that the locations were aligned. The only sure way to get this complete picture was to connect directly to the Metastore backend database. We currently support 'MYSQL' and 'POSTGRES' metastore backends. 'Oracle' coming soon.</p></section></section><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 21 August 2024</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="hms-mirror-introduction.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Introduction</a><a href="getting-started.html" class="navigation-links__next">Getting Started</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.10.0-b408/app.js"></script></body></html>
