Streever","type":"authors"},{"authors":["David W. Streever"],"categories":["analytics","devops"],"content":" A few assumptions: HDP 3.1.4 and Ambari have been used to work through these scenarios. If you\u0026rsquo;re running different versions, additional tweaks may be required.\nHive LLAP is a great way to speed up analytical queries. The caching layer and immediate task allocation model provides performance that is competitive and often faster than other traditional EDW solutions.\nLLAP\u0026rsquo;s caching layer uses an LFRU (Less Frequently Recently Used) eviction model to manage it\u0026rsquo;s caching layer. The caching layer is shared across user sessions in LLAP, which means data cached by one user/session is available to another user/session. The caching model is a significant advantage over session-scoped caches you\u0026rsquo;ll get with other big data query engines.\nFrom a practical standpoint, LLAP is best suited for BI, discovery, and dashboard-type queries. These queries share common datasets and need to respond quickly because there is usually a user waiting on the other end.\nWhile perfectly capable, using LLAP for ETL/ELT isn\u0026rsquo;t the best use of this elevated resource. Moving massive amounts of data through LLAP doing ELT/ELT work has a few effects:\nFills cache with datasets that aren\u0026rsquo;t benefiting anyone downstream. Forces eviction of cached elements that \u0026lsquo;are\u0026rsquo; benefiting other users. Consumes resources used by a community with stricter SLA\u0026rsquo;s, when the ETL/ELT community has different SLA standards. Problem So what can you do when your attached to HS2i and want to run an ETL/ELT job, which is a long-running job that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require the resources of LLAP, or you want to be a courteous user and leave some of those LLAP resources for someone else? It would be perfectly fine to run your query in the traditional HS2 environment, but you can\u0026rsquo;t/don\u0026rsquo;t want to connect to another environment just to run the query.\nSolution Well, HS2i can launch jobs into containers instead of the default \u0026rsquo;llap\u0026rsquo; environment. Therefore, saving LLAP resources and \u0026lsquo;right pathing\u0026rsquo; your workload.\nHS2i can be configurated to allow sessions to override the \u0026rsquo;execution mode\u0026rsquo; of a query. When a session is created, and a query is run, the execution mode can not be changed. Another session must be created.\nhive.execution.mode This setting is found in several places (in Ambari) and is used by a \u0026lsquo;session\u0026rsquo; to determine where a query will be executed. Options are:\ncontainer llap As with all settings we\u0026rsquo;ll mention in this article, make sure you are reviewing/setting the values that are appropriate for the environment your in. For example: In Ambari and LLAP, see the \u0026lsquo;hive-interactive-*\u0026rsquo; sections.\nThe hive.execution.mode setting is set and defaults to the appropriate mode for the environment. Meaning, \u0026lsquo;container\u0026rsquo; is set for the \u0026lsquo;HS2\u0026rsquo; environment, and \u0026rsquo;llap\u0026rsquo; is set for the \u0026lsquo;HS2i\u0026rsquo; environment. We do NOT want to make this change at the environment level. We will only change this at the session level.\nSome Caveats With Workload Management Enabled\nYou can NOT request an alternate YARN queue to run. All \u0026lsquo;container\u0026rsquo; execution mode queries will run in the \u0026lsquo;Workload\u0026rsquo; queue defined by hive.server2.tez.interactive.queue.\nWithout Workload Management Enabled\nYou CAN request an alternate YARN queue to run \u0026lsquo;container\u0026rsquo; mode requests in.\nControls Session Level Settings After adjusting a few environment settings to allow an \u0026lsquo;alternate\u0026rsquo; execution mode, the execution path is controlled by the session. Users wanting to use the \u0026lsquo;alternate\u0026rsquo; path will declare the alternate path before launching the job. If nothing is specified, jobs will run in LLAP. As I mentioned before, once a query has been run in a session, the execution mode for that session can NOT be changed. Doing so will result in an error. A new session is required, if they wish the change the execution mode.\nEnvironment Level Settings (Defaults) Note the sections for each of these settings. Ambari has the same settings in many areas to control different deployments of Hive Server2.\nLLAP Daemon and Concurrency Settings (Default) What\u0026rsquo;s interesting is that the default configuration runs the LLAP daemons AND the concurrency AM in the same queue. But this isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary, as we\u0026rsquo;ll see later.\nLLAP Execution Restrictions (Default) We\u0026rsquo;ll change this restriction to allow users to set the hive.exection.mode later in the options section.\nLLAP Interactive Queue The \u0026lsquo;interactive\u0026rsquo; setting needs to be set to enable Workload Management. The Workload Management AM will run in the defined queue. These AM\u0026rsquo;s represent each concurrent query (capability) for LLAP. That concurrency is defined by the aggregate of the parallelism configured for Workload Management. See this example script as a guide for starting Workload Management. It is not controlled via the concurrency settings we\u0026rsquo;ve seen before (hive.server2.tez.sessions.per.default.queue).\nEnvironment Level Setting Changes Remove the hive.execution.mode value from \u0026ldquo;Restricted session configs\u0026rdquo; (hive.server2.tez.sessions.restricted.configs) Allow Custom Queues by changing ignore to true hive.server2.tez.sessions.custom.queue.allowed=true Optional Environment Setting Tweaks (Queues) These settings have more to do with where you want parts of the system to run (which queues).\nhive.server2.tez.default.queues controls where the Concurrency AM\u0026rsquo;s will run when Workload Management is NOT enabled.\nhive.llap.daemon.queue.name controls where the LLAP environment will run.\nhive.server2.tez.interactive.queue controls where the Workload Management AM\u0026rsquo;s will run, when Workload Management is activated.\nOptions The behavior changes a bit, depending on whether you\u0026rsquo;re using Workload Management or not. My suggestion is to NOT enable Workload Management at first to see what lands in which queue. Once you activate Workload Management, you will NOT be able to launch jobs in container mode outside the queue setup in hive.server2.tez.interactive.queue .\nOption #1 - Without Workload Management Scenario: Run LLAP and Concurrency AM\u0026rsquo;s in the same queue. Allow users to specify an alternate queue to run container mode jobs.\nWhen jobs are launched in container execution mode, YARN will allocate task resources alongside the AM controlling the \u0026lsquo;DAG.\u0026rsquo; So where ever you launch the AM for the job, that queue will need resources to run the job.\nEnvironment\nhive.server2.tez.sessions.restricted.configs=hive.execution.engine hive.server2.tez.sessions.custom.queue.allowed=true Unset (To disable Workload Management)\nhive.server2.tez.interactive.queue Session Level\nSet via Hive/Beeline Init, Script, or JDBC connection string.\nset hive.execution.mode=container set tez.queue.name=\u0026lt;target_queue\u0026gt; Launch the query and check the Resource Manager. You should see the AM in the target queue, and that application in YARN will grow additional containers to run the job.\nOption #2 - Without Workload Management Scenario: Run LLAP and Concurrency AM\u0026rsquo;s in different queues. Allow users to specify an alternate queue to run container mode jobs.\nWhen jobs are launched in container execution mode, YARN will allocate task resources alongside the AM controlling the \u0026lsquo;DAG.\u0026rsquo; So where ever you launch the AM for the job, that queue will need resources to run the job.\nEnvironment\nhive.server2.tez.sessions.restricted.configs=hive.execution.engine hive.server2.tez.sessions.custom.queue.allowed=true hive.server2.tez.default.queues=llap_tez_am hive.llap.daemon.queue.name=llap Unset (To disable Workload Management)\nhive.server2.tez.interactive.queue Session Level\nSet via Hive/Beeline Init, Script, or JDBC connection string.\nset hive.execution.mode=container set tez.queue.name=\u0026lt;target_queue\u0026gt; Launch the query and check the Resource Manager. You should see the AM in the target queue, and that AM in YARN will grow additional containers to run the job.\nOption #3 - With Workload Management Scenario: LLAP and Workload Management AM in different queues. Users will NOT be able to specify an alternate queue. The Workload Management AM will grow to fulfill the DAG request. The YARN queue hive.server2.tez.interactive.queue will need to be large enough to contain the other Workload Management AM\u0026rsquo;s in addition to the job requirements. If the queue is small and the other Workload AM\u0026rsquo;s have not been allocated or reclaimed during a quiet period, new jobs may not launch right away.\nEnvironment\nhive.server2.tez.sessions.restricted.configs=hive.execution.engine hive.server2.tez.sessions.custom.queue.allowed=true -- Utilitization of \u0026#39;llap_tez_am\u0026#39; should be nil with Workload Management hive.server2.tez.default.queues=llap_tez_am hive.llap.daemon.queue.name=llap Set (To enable Workload Management).

Streever"],"categories":["upgrade"],"content":"If you are an RHEL/CentOS shop, version 7 should be your target OS for Hadoop. But if you\u0026rsquo;re cluster has been around a while, you probably have a few machines on version 6.x.\nUnfortunately, RHEL / CentOS don\u0026rsquo;t offer an upgrade path from 6 to 7. The only certified option is to wipe the OS and reinstall, which is a problem when it\u0026rsquo;s part of an active cluster.\nThere are 3 methods for dealing with this.\nDecommission the node and replace it. Migrate the workloads to another cluster and rebuild. Hot swap the OS. Decommission Method Decommissioning is a process which gracefully migrates data off a data node in a controlled manner. Thereby removing the data node from the active cluster while ensuring the integrity of the data is maintained.\nThis approach is pretty conservative and general only practically for a small number of nodes.\nWith replication set to 3, the default, you can only decommission two nodes at a time. Beyond that, you risk data being unavailable for a period. See It\u0026rsquo;s your last block.\nWith rack awareness, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to do this a rack at a time. But beware, if rack awareness wasn\u0026rsquo;t initially configured, you can experience data loss/availability issues. Always monitor the namenode for data availability issues.\nWhile the safest approach, there are three major concerns.\nNetwork Bandwidth - This process will force the movement of a dataset equivalent to the used hdfs storage on the device. Pressure on the Namenode - Namenode resources are required to manage the movement/tracking of blocks left under replicated by the decommissioning process. Time - This is a lengthy process. For large clusters with hundreds of nodes, it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to keep up a pace needed to replace each node within a reasonable window.\nMigration Depending on how much hardware you have around for this process, it\u0026rsquo;s not a likely option. If you happen to have an abundance of hardware around, you could migrate workloads from one cluster to another, over time.\nThe difficulties with this approach:\nRequires a duplicate set of hardware SLDC processes for an application that are using/ingesting and building the data need to be altered. Consumers needs to adjust so they can use the new cluster. Transitions in Big Data are not \u0026ldquo;atomic\u0026rdquo;. The volume ingested and changed on the source is usually too high to be synchronized atomically. Further leading to risk. Hot swapping the OS Sounds sexy, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? Well, in geek-speak it kind of is. If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with how Hadoop manages its filesystem, you know there are three things you need to preserve: fsimage, edits and block pools. When it comes down to it, if these things are safe, you can restore HDFS.\nTo hot swap the OS, you need to have followed some best practices around component/data layouts on your hardware. The first and most important part is that the data directories for the Namenodes, Journal Nodes and Data Nodes should be on physically separate devices from the OS. These drives should NOT be part of any LVM controlled by the OS. They should be simple JBOD devices, formatted as either ext4 or xfs drives.\nAs for the remaining services on your cluster, ensure that all the persisted data elements of each service aren\u0026rsquo;t co-located with the OS drive partition. Which includes (but not limited to): Zeppelin Notebooks, AMS, ATS, Application Data, NFS, etc.. Check for specific OS level customizations like CRONTAB, fstab, etc. on hosts and be prepared to reinstate those after rebuilding the OS.\nTo run this process against your master nodes and continue to support operations in your cluster, the master services for HDFS, YARN, HBase, Oozie, Druid, and Hive should be configured with HA.\nThe cluster metadata stores for Ambari, Hive, Oozie, Ranger, and Druid should be on separately managed RDBMS host(s) and aren\u0026rsquo;t a part of the OS upgrade process we\u0026rsquo;ll cover here.\nIf the above isn\u0026rsquo;t true, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make it accurate before you can continue with this upgrade method.\nThis process relies on fast and consistent OS (re)builds. For that, I suggest that you invest some time in DevOps automation in the form of Ansible, Puppet, Chef or some other provisioning toolset. You need to be able to rebuild and host and have it ready to be added back to the cluster in under 15 minutes. That may be aggressive, but consider what happens when a data node is marked \u0026lsquo;dead\u0026rsquo;, which will occur after 10 minutes. A lot of traffic and resources will start to be consumed, attempting to repair the missing replicas in the system left by the missing block pool that was managed by the host you\u0026rsquo;re upgrading. So our goal is to reduce the amount of time that the block pool on the host is out of the cluster.\nSome considerations before shutting the host down:\nIf you want to manage YARN gracefully, you can decommission yarn through Ambari. We will NOT \u0026lsquo;decommission\u0026rsquo; the Data Node. If this is a Master with an Active Component, fail it over to the other server before starting this process. This provides you with a bit more control over the process. With the chosen host, go ahead and shut it down. And start the OS migration process.\nAs I mentioned earlier, all persisted state information needs to be on a different physical drive(s) than the OS. The reason for this is that we\u0026rsquo;re going to rebuild the OS partition completely. This means formatting ONLY THE ROOT DEVICE and reinstalling the new OS on it. As long as the persisted stores are on other devices, our data is safe.\nThe process for rebuilding the OS should include all major pre-requisites for a Hadoop cluster, but not limited to this list:\nTHP (Transparent Huge Pages) disabled NNTP installed and active IDM integration (sssd or other) JDK 8 - latest version installed OS Patches applied SELinux - disabled Swappiness=1 for worker nodes Consult the Hortonworks documentation for further details.\nIt is CRITICAL that the host retains the same FQDN as before the upgrade. If this changes, we will NOT be able to use Ambari to complete the process. The hosts \u0026lsquo;fstab\u0026rsquo; configuration should match what was previously configured, regarding the data drives. Don\u0026rsquo;t change mount points at this time, it will only complicate the process and setup.\nIn addition to these, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install the Ambari-Agent on the host and configure it for the Ambari-Server.\nsudo ambari-agent reset ${AMBARI_SERVER_HOST} Now that we have the host rebuilt with the basics and an Ambari-Agent up and running, we should be able to see the host connected to Ambari via the Hosts Page.\nAt this point, you have a host that has been re-associated to Ambari successfully. In the host details section, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice how the host now identifies with version 7 of the OS. And at this point, the host will have none of the HDP libraries installed.\nWhile none of the HDP libraries are installed, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that Ambari knows what services should be on the host. That\u0026rsquo;s because the host FQDN matches the previous OS version of the host and when the \u0026lsquo;ambari-agent\u0026rsquo; registered back with the \u0026lsquo;ambari-server\u0026rsquo;, the host assumed the former identity.\nThis host will also NOT have the previous system accounts for HDP, yet. IE: hdfs, yarn, hive, etc\u0026hellip;\nAmbari Server has a new feature, added in 2.6, that allows us to recover a host in this state. From the \u0026lsquo;host\u0026rsquo; window there\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026lsquo;Host Action\u0026rsquo; button in the upper right corner.\nSelect this and \u0026lsquo;Recover Host\u0026rsquo;. Ambari will reinstall and configure all the missing services on this host, as they were before.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re almost there, do NOT start the services yet!!! The remounted data directories that still contain all our data (that was the whole point of this exercise) need to be fixed. Most likely that the POSIX UID\u0026rsquo;s for the user and group assigned in the previous OS, do NOT match or even exist in the new OS. So the data drive permissions will not be properly configured. We need to fix this before starting the services.\nLocate each of the data directories and adjust (recursively) the ownership to match the new uid\u0026rsquo;s. For example: The NN data directory at /data/0/hadoop/hdfs/namenode. We need to ensure hdfs:hadoop owns the directory.\nchown -R hdfs:hadoop /data/0/hadoop/hdfs/namenode Make these adjustments for each of the data directories on the host including, but not limited to:\nNamenode Secondary Namenode (when applicable) Journal Node ZooKeeper ATS Yarn (local and logs) Datanode (Block Pools) Log Directories (if these were on separate drives and survived the OS rebuild) Pid Directories (if these were on separate drives and survived the OS rebuild) Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve fixed the permissions, we can restart the services on the host.\nValidate At this point, you should validate the services are operating as expected. The validation should be thorough to ensure the host is a healthy member of the cluster BEFORE proceeding on to the next host.\nSome known gotcha\u0026rsquo;s Not all running jobs are tolerant to failed nodes. For example: a long running Spark task that dies because the host was removed, may not recover very well. In which case, the job may need to be restarted. When cycling through the master services, dropping a Hive Server 2 host will cause job failures for those connected to that host. If you consumers are using the ZooKeeper discovery protocol and you have multiple HiveServer2 instances, they\u0026rsquo;ll be routed to a working HiveServer2. Stagger the replacement of these HiveServer2 nodes to avoid chasing active connections down and killing them in short order. Some master services that aren\u0026rsquo;t HA will experience downtime as they go through this process. I suggest that the process be managed more carefully across the master nodes, opposed to the worker nodes. If you\u0026rsquo;re running LLAP, ensure the queue has enough room to support a missing host. LLAP daemons will attempt to restart, when a host is brought down and will need a place to go. Automation Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve seen how this can be done, it\u0026rsquo;s time to automate this. Using your companies DevOps automation tools and practices, you should be able to cycle through a host upgrade every 15-30 minutes. You should be able to cycle through all the worker nodes in record time.\nWe briefly discussed a DevOps model to automate the OS rebuild. Another automation measure to consider is through Ambari.\nIf you have several hundred nodes to do this to, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to investigate the Ambari REST API and automate the actions we\u0026rsquo;ve performed through the Ambari UI.\n","date":1523923200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523923200,"objectID":"4064855c6bc0f3765778dc27baf5f440","permalink":"http://www.streever.com/post/2018/in-place-centos6-to-centos7-hdp/","publishdate":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018/in-place-centos6-to-centos7-hdp/","section":"post","summary":"Without a clean 'supported' process for upgrading CentOS/RHEL 6 to 7, migrating to CentOS/RHEL 7 on an existing HDP cluster is a challenge.

Streever"],"categories":["devops"],"content":"The Problem Traditional \u0026lsquo;distcp\u0026rsquo; from one directory to another or from cluster to cluster is quite useful in moving massive amounts of data, once. But what happens when you need to \u0026ldquo;update\u0026rdquo; a target directory or cluster with only the changes made since the last \u0026lsquo;distcp\u0026rsquo; had run. That becomes a very tricky scenario. \u0026lsquo;distcp\u0026rsquo; offers an \u0026lsquo;-update\u0026rsquo; flag, which is suppose to move only the files that have changed. In this case \u0026lsquo;distcp\u0026rsquo; will pull a list of files and directories from the source and targets, compare them and then build a migration plan.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an expensive and time-consuming task. Furthermore, the process is not atomic. First, the cost of gathering a list of files and directories, along with their metadata is expensive when you\u0026rsquo;re considering sources with millions of file and directory objects. And this cost is incurred on both the source and target namenode\u0026rsquo;s, resulting in quite a bit of pressure on those systems.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s up to distcp to reconcile the difference between the source and target, which is very expensive. When it\u0026rsquo;s finally complete, only then does the process start to move data. And if data changes while the process is running, those changes can impact the transfer and lead to failure and partial migration.\nThe Solution The process needs to be atomic, and it needs to be efficient. With Hadoop 2.0, HDFS introduce \u0026ldquo;snapshots.\u0026rdquo; HDFS \u0026ldquo;snapshots\u0026rdquo; are a point-in-time copy of the directories metadata. The copy is stored in a hidden location and maintains references to all of the immutable filesystem objects. Creating a snapshot is atomic, and the characteristics of HDFS (being immutable) means that an image of a directories metadata doesn\u0026rsquo;t require an addition copy of the underlying data.\nAnother feature of snapshots is the ability to efficiently calculate changes between \u0026lsquo;any\u0026rsquo; two snapshots on the same directory. Using \u0026lsquo;hdfs snapshotDiff \u0026lsquo;, you can build a list of \u0026ldquo;changes\u0026rdquo; between these two point-in-time references.\nFor Example [hdfs@m3 ~]$ hdfs snapshotDiff /user/dstreev/stats s1 s2 Difference between snapshot s1 and snapshot s2 under directory /user/dstreev/stats:\nM .+./attempt M ./namenode/fs_state/2016-12.txt M ./namenode/nn_info/2016-12.txt M ./namenode/top_user_ops/2016-12.txt M ./scheduler/queue_paths/2016-12.txt M ./scheduler/queue_usage/2016-12.txt M ./scheduler/queues/2016-12.txt Let\u0026rsquo;s take the \u0026lsquo;distcp\u0026rsquo; update concept and supercharge it with the efficiency of snapshots. Now you have a solution that will scale far beyond the original distcp -update. and in the process remove the burden and load from the namenode\u0026rsquo;s previously encountered.\nPre-Requisites and Requirements Source must support hdfs \u0026lsquo;snapshots\u0026rsquo; hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; Target is \u0026ldquo;read-only\u0026rdquo;\nTarget, after initial baseline \u0026lsquo;distcp\u0026rsquo; sync needs to support snapshots.\nProcess Identify the source and target \u0026lsquo;parent\u0026rsquo; directory Do not initially create the destination directory, allow the first distcp to do that. For example: If I want to sync source /data/a with /data/a_target, do NOT pre-create the \u0026lsquo;a_target\u0026rsquo; directory. Allow snapshots on the source directory hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /data/a Create a Snapshot of /data/a hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /data/a s1 Distcp the baseline copy (from the atomic snapshot). Note: /data/a_target does NOT exists prior to the following command. hadoop distcp /data/a/.snapshot/s1 /data/a_target Allow snapshots on the newly create target directory hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /data/a_target At this point /data/a_target should be considered \u0026ldquo;read-only\u0026rdquo;. Do NOT make any changes to the content here.\nCreate a matching snapshot in /data/a_target that matches the name of the snapshot used to build the baseline hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /data/a_target s1 Add some content to the source directory /data/a. Make changes, add, deletes, etc. that need to be replicated to /data/a_target.\nTake a new snapshot of /data/a hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /data/a s2 Just for fun, check on whats changed between the two snapshots\nhdfs snapshotDiff /data/a s1 s2 Ok, now let\u0026rsquo;s migrate the changes to /data/a_target hadoop distcp -diff s1 s2 -update /data/a /data/a_target When that\u0026rsquo;s completed, finish the cycle by creating a matching snapshot on /data/a_target hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /data/a_target s2 That\u0026rsquo;s it. You\u0026rsquo;ve completed the cycle. Rinse and repeat.\nA Few Hints Remember, snapshots need to be managed manually. They will stay around forever unless you clean them up with:\nhdfs dfs -deleteSnapshot As long as a snapshot exists, the data exists. Deleting, even with skipTrash, data from a directory that has a snapshot, doesn\u0026rsquo;t free up space. Only when all \u0026ldquo;references\u0026rdquo; to that data are gone, can space be reclaimed.\nInitial migrations of data between systems are very expensive in regards to network I/O. And you probably don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to do that again, ever. I recommend keeping a snapshot of the original copy on each system OR some major checkpoint you can go back to, in the event the process is compromised.\nIf \u0026lsquo;distcp\u0026rsquo; can\u0026rsquo;t validate that the snapshot (by name) between the source and the target are the same and that the data at the target hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed since the snapshot, the process will fail. If the failure is because the directory has been updated, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use the above baseline snapshots to restore it without having to migrate all that data again. And then start the process up again.\n","date":1490832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490832000,"objectID":"690e8796384699aad0122477889d96a9","permalink":"http://www.streever.com/post/2017/distcp-with-snapshots/","publishdate":"2017-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017/distcp-with-snapshots/","section":"post","summary":"Tradition 'distcp' update are brutal and costly.
